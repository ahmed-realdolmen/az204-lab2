# Improvements

- What should be updated in the code to use Append blobs? Implement it.
- Deploy api using `az` command (Azure CLI)
- When writing a line to a blob, set the metadata "LastWriteBy" be equal to the IP address of the client (Http Client making the request)
- Instead of hardcoding "notes" in the code, make it a setting and set its value from the Azure Portal
